# Release history

## Version 1.0.2 [unpublished]

### Changes

- 

### Bugfixes

-

## Version 1.0.1 (October 2024)

### Changes

- Added a plotting function that supports the Brownie Bee user interface (see browniebee.io).
- Made small improvements to the plot_objective_1d function, and added it to __init.py__ for ProcessOptimizer.

### Bugfixes

-

## Version 1.0.0 (September 2024)

### Changes

- Documentation about the features in control parameters and sampling control parameters.
- ModelSystems moved to creator systems, so they are only created when you ask for them. You now need to use `ProcessOptimizer.model_systems.get_model_system(model_system_name)` to create them. This has two advantages: If you change a model system, it doesn't affect a new instance of it. And ProcessOptimizer should import faster, since fewer objects are created i memory.
- Radius changed in certain Bokeh plots
- Default Pareto plot has more points on Pareto-front (40 -> 100)

### Bugfixes

- Setting noise-size in zero-noise models will now raise an error
- Multible imports of a model system will now provide separate instances

## Version 0.9.5 (May 2024)

### Changes

- Updated package requirements for Brownie Bee user interface.
- Examples reworked.
- opt.estimate() implemented - Works in non-transformed space and on all objectives.

### Bugfixes

- Fix that categorical dimensions with more than two levels induces error when used 
  together with SumEqual constraint.
- Fix that Bokeh has changed naming convention related to sizes of circles in their
  plots from "size" to "radius".

## Version 0.9.4

### Changes

-

### Bugfixes

- Fix dependency on deprecated Matrix from scipy in favour of a numpy solution
- Ensure prober warning/Errors when users try to combine constraints with operations that
  doesn't support constraints.

## Version 0.9.3

### Changes

-

### Bugfixes

- Fix install bug that precluded installation of 0.9.2

## Version 0.9.2

### Changes

- Update ipynb file showing example of color_pH modelsystem. (Very minor)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug in `expected_minimum` where SumEquals constraint values were not rescaled
  correctly during normalization.

## Version 0.9.1

### Changes

- Added colorpH as ModelSystem
- Exposed Integer, Real, Categorical and ModelSystem as direct imports of ProcessOptimizer.

### Bugfixes

- Changed the result object to store information about constraints (when present).
- Updated `expected_minimum` to make sure that the returned result location respects
  SumEquals constraints if these were used during the optimization.

## Version 0.9.0

### Changes

-

### Bugfixes

- Fix install issue in 0.8.2. Th installed package could not be imported.

## Version 0.8.2

### Changes

- **BREAKING**: `cook_estimator`, `has_gradients`, and `use_named_args` are moved from
  `utils` to `learning`.
- **BREAKING**: `normalize_dimensions` is moved from `utils` to `space`.
- **BREAKING**: `branin`, `hart3`, `hart6`, `poly2`, and `peaks` has been changed to noisy and noiseless `ModelSystem`s.
- Implemented tests for ModelSystems.
- `gold_map` exist as `ModelSystem`.
- Sampling consolidated. There is now only one sampling function per `Dimension`.
  Different sampling types (at the moment, random value sampling and Latin Hypercube
  Sampling (LHS)) are handled through `Space`, referencing the sampling functions of the
  `Dimesion`s
- LHS now allows for arbitrary seeding, or for random seeding, better supporting
  benchmarking. The algorithm still uses a fixed seed by default.
- The module `space` uses `np.random.default_rng` as a random number generator, instead
  of the deprecated `np.random.RandomState`. A bridging strategy allows it to still
  accept `RandomState`s, but it will tranform them to `default_rng` for internal use.
  The rest of the codebase still uses `RandomState`.
- **BREAKING**: LHS now respects priors. This means that performing LHS on a space with
  a log-normal `Real` `Dimension`, or a `Categorical` `Dimension` with informative
  priors will give different results in this release than in previous releases.
- **BREAKING**: The mechanism for seeding pseudorandom generators in the `space` module
  have changed, meaning that, while the results are reproducible within a release, they
  will not be the same as in old releases.
- Bokeh is now (again) a required installation.

### Bugfixes

- Fixes to `DataDependentNoise` and `SumNoise` to avoid highly correlated
  noise of the underlying noise models.
- Switched to local imports internally to avoid circular import errors.
- `NoiseModel._noise_distribution` is now a method, to allow changes of
  `self._rng` to affect `self._noise_distribution` automatically.
- Removed max_features='auto' to avoid using hardcoded variables to external functions

## Version 0.8.1

### Changes

- Added additonal model systems to the list of benchmarks and made their
  structure more consistent.
- Added seeding to the noise models used for benchmarking to ensure
  reproducible results when benchmarking.
- Allow addition or removal of modelled noise to the optimizer object. This
  is to allow user to predict the full outcome space of a given new exp.

### Bugfixes

- Fix a small number of deprecationwarnings.

## Version 0.8.0

### Changes

- Default acquisition function changed to expected improvement (EI)
- Updated list of contributors

  designed to be used for mixture experiments where a (sub)set of factors must
  sum to a specific number.

- QoL opt.space.names added as property
- Changed default behavior of plot_objective to show uncertainty in 1D plots
